# 42-fdf
I built a Graphics library and used it to build this 3d wireframe renderer, that can load multiple models, translate and rotate them independently in 3d space. I used perspective projection to make the objects look more realistic. You can also move the camera around in 3d space. The only thing I was given was a function to put a single pixel on the screen and hooks for user input events
